This is a custom version of Suite2p that basically adds few function that allow one to easily process data collected in the Kuhlman lab. Otherwise the code is kept as close to the original as possible (at least for now).
All "heavy lifting" is done by the functions of the original Suite2P toolbox, hence 99.8% of all credits belong to the original authors :)
